SNHU CS 499 ePortfolio - Adrian Aguilar

Welcome to my Computer Science ePortfolio. This site showcases my academic and professional growth throughout the SNHU Computer Science program, with a focus on software design, data structures, and database management.

## Featured Projects

### [CS 340 – Animal Shelter CRUD Application](https://github.com/AdrianAg321/AdrianAguilar-CS340-FinalDashboard)
This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a full-stack database application. It uses Python, Flask, and MongoDB to manage animal adoption records, featuring CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with secure data handling and user interaction.

### [DAT 325 – Data Validation and Cleaning Project](https://github.com/AdrianAg321/AdrianAguilar-DAT325-DataCleaning)
This project focuses on applying algorithmic techniques and data structures to clean, validate, and transform large datasets using Python and the Pandas library. It emphasizes data accuracy, performance optimization, and the automation of repetitive data preparation tasks.

## About Me
I am a Computer Science major at Southern New Hampshire University with a focus on database management, data analysis, and software engineering. This ePortfolio represents my ability to apply technical concepts to solve real-world problems through secure, efficient, and scalable solutions.
